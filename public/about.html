<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! I’m a web developer with a passion for helping individuals and small businesses bring their ideas to life online. 
  Whether you’re launching your first website or need a fresh, modern redesign, I’m here to make the process easy, creative,
  and effective. I specialize in clean, responsive web design that looks great on any device and is built with user experience in mind.</p>

<p>I’m currently completing The Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu — a comprehensive course that’s helped me build strong
  foundations in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and full-stack development. With each project I complete, I focus not just on functionality
  and visual appeal, but also on performance and accessibility. I believe a good website doesn’t just represent your brand — it works hard for it.</p>

<p>My goal is to create websites that truly reflect your vision and support your goals, whether that means attracting more customers, telling
  your story, or simply having a place online that feels like “you.” If you’re looking for someone reliable, detail-oriented, and excited to collaborate,
  I’d love to work with you. Let’s build something great together!</p>
